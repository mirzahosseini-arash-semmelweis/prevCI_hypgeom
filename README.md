Prevalence Estimation in Finite Populations Adjusted for Misclassification

Three methods are presented for estimating true prevalence and constructing confidence intervals from finite populations using the hypergeometric model that account for misclassification:

1. An exact method for constructing Clopperâ€“Pearson and Blaker-type confidence intervals under the hypergeometric distribution.
2. A simulation-based approach to estimate exact confidence intervals with improved computational efficiency.
3. A Bayesian estimation method, incorporating prior beliefs about prevalence into the inference process.
